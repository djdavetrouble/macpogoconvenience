A script and instructions to add keyboard text replacements for trash and perfect pokemon go IVs
Install https://github.com/rodionovd/shortcuts/releases into /usr/local/bin

Download all of this stuff from this guthub (green clone or download button up and to the right)

Open a Terminal

Type "cd " <thats a space after cd < don't type the quotes actually  

Then drag the folder that you downloaded from guthub  

then hit return  

then "cd PoGo-Convenience-chopped\ and\ screwed" < don't type the quotes actually  

Then hit return  

Make it Executable!  
type chmod +x ivsmackdown.sh  
  
Run the Script!  
type "./ivsmackdown.sh"  

watch the fun  
Make sure your computer and device are signed into icloud and have documents and stuff syncing  
now you have the shortcuts for every pokemon with "t" or "p" appended to the end. 

For example, a perfect pidgey search would be pidgeyp 
You need to do a space after the text replacement string to trigger the replacement if you have never done this before.
